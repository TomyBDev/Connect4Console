Quickly created as a simble example for minimax for computer move selection. 

There is currently no diagonal win detection, so ignore that, and the depth of the minimax algorithmn is also capped since there are too many possible states. 

An improved heuristic or some tree pruning could also improve the performance, but was not my goal with this.
